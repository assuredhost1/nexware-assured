"""
Authentication router — login, logout, current user.

Uses JWT (HS256) signed with the JWT_SECRET_KEY from settings.

Login resolves an identifier against four separate tables in a fixed order
(admin → picker → sales → dashboard) and stamps the winning table's name into
the token as the ``user_type`` claim. Everything downstream trusts that claim to
pick a table, so it must be set here and nowhere else.

    End a session. Always succeeds, with or without a usable token.

    This required a valid token until it was found to be answering 401 several
    times a second, forever, to phones in the field. Requiring one is circular:
    a client calls this precisely when its token has stopped working, so the
    answer was always 401 — and the mobile client reacted to any 401 by signing
    out, which called this again. Each attempt failed the same way and scheduled
    another, so the loop never terminated and the session was never actually
    cleared. The client-side guard is in, but every device already installed
    keeps the old behaviour until it is updated; answering 200 ends the loop for
    those too, without waiting for a new build.

    Signing out is also simply not an operation that should be refusable. There
    is nothing to protect: the caller is discarding its own credentials, and a
    request with no valid token has already achieved everything this endpoint
    does server-side. Idempotent, and safe to call twice.
