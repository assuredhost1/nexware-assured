"""
The Sales Dashboard's data source, and the territory scoping applied to it.

WHY THE BACKEND IS IN THE MIDDLE. The sales history lives in the legacy sales
app's Supabase project, behind two RPCs (``ng2_bootstrap``, ``ng2_dashboard``).
The browser used to call them directly with that project's anon key, and the
territory filter was a list of customer ids the browser chose to send. Both
halves of that were unenforceable:

* the key was in the JS bundle, so anyone could call ``ng2_dashboard``
  themselves and simply omit the customer filter;
* ``ng2_dashboard`` ignores ``p_customers`` when building its ``custIds``
  reply, and ``ng2_bootstrap`` returns the whole 3,859-name customer
  dictionary, so even a correctly-scoped call handed the full customer master
  to a viewer entitled to one territory.

So the scope is applied HERE, on a server the viewer cannot edit, and the
response is cut down to it before it is sent. The key never leaves the server.
This does not move the data — it still lives in that project — but the browser
no longer has any way to reach it except through a scoped request.

WHERE THE TERRITORY MAP COMES FROM. ``backend/data/area_customers.json``, the
generated map of supervisor area -> customer ids, per channel. It is the one
copy: the frontend reads it from this backend rather than keeping its own, so
the picker that WRITES a grant and the code that ENFORCES one cannot disagree
about which customers a territory holds.
