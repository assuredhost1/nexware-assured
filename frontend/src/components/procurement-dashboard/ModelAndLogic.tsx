          MPPI - the ceiling
        </h3>
        <p>The MPPI target is the <b>Maximum Procurement Price Index</b> - the highest price the business can pay for a raw material while still making a 15% margin on the finished pack.</p>
        <p>It is computed by walking the costing sheet backwards. For every in-scope SKU made from that material, the margin is removed from the selling price, and the known costs of all other inputs (packing material, labour, overhead) are subtracted. The remainder is divided by the kilos of raw material in the pack. That is the ceiling for that pack. The lowest ceiling across all packs in a raw material's group is the <b>binding</b> target - the tightest constraint, which guarantees the margin on every pack if met.</p>
        <div className="bg-primary/5 border-l-4 border-primary p-4 text-primary-900 rounded-r">
          The target is a <b>single number per raw material</b>. It comes from selling prices, so it does not move when you switch market or price point - only the references it is compared against do.

          Desk - market, price point, stock policy
        </h3>
        <p>The desk reports the market; it does not take quotes. Every figure on it is <b>OMR per kilogram</b>, including <b>Latest market price</b>, which carries the most recent published data point for that commodity on that basis together with the date it was published.</p>
        <p><b>Stock cover</b> is the days of stock the raw material has left, and it is templated until the Inventory feed is connected. The register gives the replenishment rhythm - a normal lot size and an average daily usage.</p>
        <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6">The verdict is four words. Price decides three of them; stock decides the fourth.</p>

        <p>{META.nTx} purchase-register lines: {META.nRev} are credit notes, and those plus the purchases they reverse are removed before a last price is taken.</p>
        <p>Green reads favourable and red unfavourable, but colour is never the only channel: every state also carries a word and a direction mark, and every variance carries its sign.</p>
